# Pictafy
Social Media App that tracks the location of pictures for friends and families or for a personal journal.

# Introduction
Pictafy is a memory archive/social media application in which users can take pictures and record the location of where the picture was taken. These pictures can then be posted publicly or stored privately. Users will also be able to see different pictures based on their location, creating a sense of community when exploring the world. In addition, users can write a description alongside their photos creating a personal memory vault to look back at. Pictafy is designed for teenagers up to adults in their 30s, but can be used by all ages similarly to most social media these days. 

Exploring a new area can often be stressful as you are unsure of what to do or where to eat. This app will provide users with pictures with descriptions based on their location, highlighting some of the more interesting things to do in the area. In general social media doesnâ€™t encourage getting out and experiencing life, whereas Pictafy attempts to entice users to explore nearby locations for themselves and share them with others. There will be a heavy focus on privacy with the users having complete control over their pictures with the ability to set their visibility.
